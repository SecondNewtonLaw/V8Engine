# V8Engine
An opinionated way of Roblox game development. Made for theoretical purposes only, practical uses are NOT tested!

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "V8Engine.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `V8Engine.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
